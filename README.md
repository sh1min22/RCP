# Connectivity-Oriented Property Graph Partitioning for Distributed Graph Pattern Query Processing

# Overview
relationship connectivity partitioning(RCP) is a edge-centric property graph partitioning approach, where the objective function is to minimize the cuts to the number of distinct crossing properties. This approach can be used to avoid inter-partition joins in a wider set of Cypher/Gremlin workloads in the context of distributed Cypher/Gremlin query evaluation.

# Benchmark Queries
The benchmark queries used in our experimental evaluation exists in #queries# folder.
